# Write a function called `make_sandwich()` that sticks to the following:
# - takes a type of bread as its first, required argument
# - takes an arbitrary amount of toppings
# - returns a string representing a sandwich with the bread on top
#   and bottom, and the toppings in between.

def make_sandwich(bread_type, toppings):
    return f"{bread_type} {toppings} {bread_type}"

print(make_sandwich("wheat", "ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato")) # wheat ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato wheat
