Do an online search for interesting Python packages on PyPI.
You can search for something you're interested to do with your programming
skills and add "Python package" to the search query.
- What do you find?
- Create a new virtual environment and install the package.
- Check out its documentation and their "Getting Started" guide
  and code examples, if there are any.
- Can you get some basic functionality of the package to work locally?

Check folder "05_03_Lab_Requests"
--not sure if it's going to save so here is my code:
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import time

headers = {
    'User-Agent': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/58.0.3029.110 Safari/537.3'
}

url = 'https://www.google.com'
response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

session = requests.Session()
session.headers.update(headers)
print(response.text)

if response.status_code == 200:
    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
    print(soup.prettify())
