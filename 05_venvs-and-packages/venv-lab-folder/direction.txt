Create a new folder. Inside of that folder:
1. Create a new Python virtual environment
2. Activate the virtual environment
3. Install three external packages in the virtual environment.
    1) Requests
    2) Pytest
    3) Pillow
4. Freeze the installed packages to a `requirements.txt` file.
5. Deactivate the virtual environment.
6. Delete the virtual environment.
7. Create a new virtual environment.

8. Install the packages that you recorded in the `requirements.txt` file.
- yay it worked! don't forget the -r :)
